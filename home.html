        <p>My name is Jonathan Moore, I am a front-end developer and amateur strength coach. I have over 5 years of experience in building and maintaining websites from a marketing perspective. During this time, I have become fluent in html and css, as well as comfortability with JavaScript and TSQL. Through osmosis and my own endeavors, I have become functional in Photoshop to the point that I am able to manipulate images as I need them for use on a given website. In the summer of 2018, I received my MCSA in Transact SQL. I also have roughly 18 months of experience leading and managing a team of 20 people comprised of front end, and backend developers, as well as web designers. </p>
